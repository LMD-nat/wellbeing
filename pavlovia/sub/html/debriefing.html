                  <p><b>Study title:</b> Individual differences in effort-reward trade-offs during learning: impact of COVID-19</p>

                   <h3><b>What the study was about</b></h3>
                   <p>
                     The purpose of this follow-up wave is to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic on academic performance and mental health in Concordia students.
                    <br><br>
                     Student populations are uniquely affected by confinement orders, being away from their families, and distance working. 
                     Students tend to have their sleep quantity and quality deteriorate as a result of confinement relative to workers.
                     
                     The current project is unique in the sense that we have data from a large group of primarily Concordia students from immediately before the pandemic. 
                     In the follow-up wave we would like to re-assess the same individuals (that's you!) using the variables from the first online assessment and add measures of mental health. 
                     Apart from the scientific interest the data could provide important insights into a) The impact of the pandemic on mental health status and academic performance in Concordia students 
                     and b) Micro-longitudinal changes in cognitive performance, socio-emotional functioning and educational achievement.
                     <br><br>
                     To address whether this is the case, we acquired participants’ judgments about themselves in the context of the pandemic.
                     We also collected information regarding students' academic achievement and their psychological health.
                     <br><br>
                     These data will contribute to our understanding of how the pandemic has affected student wellbeing.
                     <br><br>
