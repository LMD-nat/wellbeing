## Concordia Longitudinal Wellbeing Study

Title: **Individual differences in effort-reward trade-offs during learning: impact of COVID-19**

Ethics certificate number: **30009803**

This is an online questionnaire-based study that will run on Cognition.Run for Concordia University Students. 

## Study information

During the data acquisition phase of the project the COVID 19 pandemic developed. Several studies suggest that social isolation as well as anxieties that the arise out of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic will affect cognitive performance, as well educational achievement in students (e.g., Amaral-Prado, Borghi, Mello & Grassi-Kassisse, 2020; Hasan & Bao, 2020; Wang, Lu, Ko, Chen, Li, Chang & Yen, 2020). Furthermore, results of several studies indicate that individuals with risk factors for the development of psychological disorders (such as ADHD) might be at particular risk in the current situation (Merzon et al., 2020). In the first online data assessment wave we have acquired cognitive performance measures, as well as measures of socio-emotional functioning and educational achievement. In this follow-up wave we would like to re-invite the same participants and repeat the online assessment of wave one, with additional measures of mental health indicators (i.e., anxiety, depression, resilience, coping and protective behaviours). We also aim to differentiate general reports of anxiety and depression from specific psychological symptoms in relation to the pandemic. We also seek to collect questionnaire data on resilience, coping, and protective behaviors. 

The purpose of this follow-up wave is to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic on academic performance and mental health in Concordia students. Student populations are uniquely affected by confinement orders, being away from their families, and distance working. Students tend to have their sleep quantity and quality deteriorate as a result of confinement relative to workers (Marelli et al., 2020). Investigators conducting a recent study among Brazilian university students and staff found that students—but not professors or university personnel—exhibited higher perceived stress scores, more pronounced depressive signs and lower resilience as a result of confinement during their studies (Amaral-Prado, Borghi, Mello & Grassi-Kassisse, 2020). Researchers in France reported similar findings, where 66% of university students surveyed reported increases in anxiety along with moderate to severe stress during stay-at-home-orders (Husky, Kovess-Masfety & Swendsen, 2020). 

The current project is unique in the sense that we have data from a large group of primarily Concordia students from immediately before the pandemic. In the follow-up wave we would like to re-assess the same individuals using the variables from the first online assessment and add measures of mental health. Apart from the scientific interest the data could provide important insights into a) The impact of the pandemic on mental health status and academic performance in Concordia students and b) Micro-longitudinal changes in cognitive performance, socio-emotional functioning and educational achievement.

## Background Rationale to Communicate to Students

We are interested in your personal history during the Covid-19 pandemic because it may help us to better understand the needs of students in Concordia's Psychology department. Your answers to a series of a few short questions will aid us in this effort. All answers will be kept strictly confidential. Thank you for your help.

## Social Network Scale

For data cleaning: Add lsns_fri_1, lsns_fri_2,	lsns_fri_3,	lsns_fam_1,	lsns_fam_2,	lsns_fam_3, and if =< 12, consider "at risk"

The LSNS-6 is a validated instrument designed to gauge social isolation in older adults by measuring the number and frequency of social contacts with friends and family members and the perceived social support received from these sources.

The LSNS-6 total score is an equally weighted sum of these six items. Each LSNS-6 question is scored from 0 to 5 and the total score ranges from 0 to 30.

The answers are scored as follows: none = 0, one = 1, two = 2, three or four = 3, five to eight = 4, nine or more = 5. **A score of 12 and lower delineates “at-risk” for social isolation.**

### Family

- [X] How many relatives do you see or hear from at least once a month? 

- [X] How many relatives do you feel at ease with that you can talk about private matters? 

- [X] How many relatives do you feel close to such that you could call on them for help? 

### Friends

- [X] How many friends do you see or hear from at least once a month? 

- [X] How many friends do you feel at ease with that you can talk about private matters? 

- [X] How many friends do you feel close to such that you could call on them for help? 

## Substance Use (ASSIST)

The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) by an international group of substance abuse researchers to detect and manage substance use and related problems in primary and general medical care settings.

There are different risk levels that can be calculated for each substance. [Risk levels for each availible here.](https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/assist_v3_english.pdf?ua=1)

## Need for Cognition

For data cleaning: [ngs_01 ngs_02	ngs_03	ngs_04	ngs_05	ngs_06	ngs_07	ngs_08	ngs_09	ngs_10	ngs_11	ngs_12	ngs_13	ngs_14	ngs_15	ngs_16	ngs_17	ngs_18] + 18 to score


The Need for Cognition Scale is an assessment instrument that quantitatively measures “the tendency for an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking” (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982, p. 116). Cacioppo and Petty created the Need for Cognition Scale in 1982.

## Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)


For data cleaning: add [bai_1	bai_2	bai_3	bai_4	bai_5	bai_6	bai_7	bai_8	bai_9	bai_10	bai_11	bai_12	bai_13	bai_14	bai_15	bai_16	bai_17	bai_18	bai_19	bai_20	bai_21] to score


A self report measure of anxiety with 21 questions. People rate how often they have been bothered by symptoms of anxiety. 

The total score is calculated by finding the sum of the 21 items.

Score of 0-21 = low anxiety

Score of 22-35 = moderate anxiety

Score of 36 and above = potentially concerning levels of anxiety

## Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)

For data cleaning: add [cesd_1	cesd_2	cesd_3	cesd_4	cesd_5	cesd_6	cesd_7	cesd_8	cesd_9	cesd_10	cesd_11	cesd_12	cesd_13	cesd_14	cesd_15	cesd_16	cesd_17	cesd_18	cesd_19	cesd_20] to score

A 20-item measure that asks participants to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.

The CES-D also provides cutoff scores (e.g., 16 or greater) that aid in identifying individuals at risk for clinical depression, with good sensitivity and specificity and high internal consistency (Lewinsohn, Seeley, Roberts, & Allen, 1997).

## Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS)

For data cleaning: add [cas_1	cas_2	cas_3	cas_4	cas_5] to score

Assesses dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 crisis. Has 5 items with 5 options each.

## Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)

For data cleaning: add [wsas_1	wsas_2	wsas_3	wsas_4	wsas_5] to score

The WSAS measures impairment in functioning and assesses the impact of a person’s mental health difficulties on their ability to function in terms of work, home management, social leisure, private leisure and personal or family relationships.
Options range from 0 to 8. A WSAS score above 20 appears to suggest moderately severe or worse psychopathology. 
Scores between 10 and 20 are associated with significant functional impairment but less severe clinical symptomatology. Scores below 10 appear to be associated with subclinical populations. 

## Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (10 item)

For data cleaning: add [risc_01	risc_02	risc_03	risc_04	risc_05	risc_06	risc_07	risc_08	risc_09	risc_10] to score

Quantifies self-report resilience. Higher scores indicate higher resilience. Minimum scores on each are 0 and max for each are 4. 

## Percieved Stress Scale (COVID-PSS-10)

For data cleaning: add [risc_01	risc_02	risc_03	risc_04	risc_05	risc_06	risc_07	risc_08	risc_09	risc_10] to score

The PSS uses a 5-point Likert scale to measure the degree to which individuals perceived their daily life as being stressful during the past month (0 is never and 4 is very often). Total scores range from 0 to 40. 


For data cleaning: add [pss10_01	pss10_02	pss10_03	pss10_04	pss10_05	pss10_06	pss10_07	pss10_08	pss10_09	pss10_10] to score
